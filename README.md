# Intro_to_ImageProcessing

Hello and welcome to my github repository for the Introduction to Image Processing Blog Series. If you want to replicate the projects that we worked on, make sure to follow the steps below:

#### Environment Setup:

- Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. If not, download and install the latest version of Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org).
- Optionally, you can set up a Conda environment by installing Conda from the Anaconda distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
- Open a terminal or command prompt and create a new Python environment using the desired tool (e.g., conda create --name myenv or python -m venv myenv).
- Activate the newly created environment using the appropriate command (conda activate myenv or source myenv/bin/activate).
- Install the required libraries, packages, and modules by executing the following command:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: For your maximum immersion in this project series, I recommend that you use your personal images as input data so that you can explore the provided code to its maximum potential!
